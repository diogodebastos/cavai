## Summary 📜 
Senior data scientist (5+ years) with a Ph.D. in Physics and a track record of deploying machine learning solutions that operate on large-scale, high-velocity data. I pair rigorous statistical modelling with production engineering, working closely with product, engineering, and risk stakeholders to deliver resilient analytics. Recent focus spans time-series forecasting, optimisation, and LLM-enabled automation, with experience maintaining distributed compute environments within global collaborations.

## Work experience 💻 
### [EDP](http://www.edp.com)
Lisbon, 2022/09 - current | Senior data scientist, AI/ML & quantitative analyst

- Reduced short-term price forecast error from 15% to 5% by combining LSTM, CNN, and Temporal Fusion Transformer models implemented in Python with PyTorch and SQL-backed data pipelines.
- Designed portfolio optimisation and algorithmic trading frameworks that improved gross margin by 30%, integrating ML outputs into decision workflows for trading and risk teams.
- Migrated analytics from MATLAB and R to a Python ecosystem, formalising code efficiency, scalability, and reproducibility for globally distributed stakeholders.
- Deployed predictive services and analytical applications on Databricks Services to meet availability, monitoring, and scalability requirements.
- Built LLM-powered assistants using Azure OpenAI, Llama2, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Weaviate, and LangChain to automate report generation and data interpretation. PoCs for report automation and research summarisation. Cut manual review time by >40%.
- Mentored colleagues on MLOps practices, supervised a master’s thesis on deep learning for price forecasting, and acted as product lead for ML, optimisation, and trading initiatives.

### [Whitesmith](https://www.whitesmith.co/)
Coimbra, 2016/01 - 2017/06 | Business and hardware development

- Co-founded a cold-chain IoT startup, managing product strategy, client acquisition, and data-driven validation of market needs.
- Built sensor-to-cloud monitoring across 24 devices, integrating wireless communications (2.1 GHz/433 MHz), embedded prototyping (Arduino, Raspberry Pi), and analytics (SQLite, MATLAB).
- Designed low-power PCBs with Altium and coordinated with engineers and customers to deliver reliable hardware deployments.

### [jeKnowledge](https://jeknowledge.pt/)
Coimbra, 2014/09 - 2016/02 | CEO

- Expanded the non-profit tech organisation from 10 to 30 members by redesigning recruitment and leadership development.
- Directed rebranding, launched a summer academy focused on programming and hardware, and created networking events linking academia with startups.
- Oversaw hackathons and community programs, honing stakeholder communication and execution under tight timelines.

## Research 🔬 

### Ph.D.
2018/01 - 2023/07 | High Energy Physics and Quantum Machine Learning

- Advanced supersymmetry searches within the CMS experiment by building C++ frameworks, boosted decision trees (ROOT TMVA), and TensorFlow neural networks to classify proton-proton collision data.
- Performed Bayesian statistical analyses to set stringent limits on top squark pair production cross sections at low masses, managing class imbalance and detector noise.
- Experimented with Variational Quantum Classifiers and Quantum GANs (Python, PennyLane, Qiskit) to accelerate Monte Carlo data augmentation.
- Tested and calibrated ASICs for the CMS Timing Detector upgrade and maintained computing operations for the CMS collaboration, ensuring data integrity across distributed resources.
- Mentored junior researchers and organised outreach events to promote STEM education.
