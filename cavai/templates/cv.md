## üî¨ Research

### Ph.D. | High Energy Physics and Quantum Machine Learning
2018/01 - 2023/07

**Advanced Research:** Pushed the state-of-the-art of high energy physics by measuring the
most stringent limits for top squark pair production cross section at low masses. This was
accomplished by analyzing the proton-proton collision at the Large Hadron Collider
detected by the Compact Muon Solenoid at CERN. I built the code framework using C++
due to the size of the samples and boosted decision trees (ROOT TMVA) and neural
networks (Tensorflow) as a machine learning method to classify simulated data. Python
and batch scripting were also used. A statistical analysis is performed in the end using
Bayesian statistics to test the hypothesis of supersymmetry and dark matter in the context
of the four-body decay of the top squark.

**Monte Carlo Enhancement:** Improved Standard Model simulations by analyzing
lepton-neutrino kinematics from W boson decays.

**Detector Algorithm:** Developed an algorithm to estimate fake leptons due to detector
ineÔ¨Éciencies.

**Quantum Classification:** Applied Variational Quantum Classifiers with Python and
PennyLane, matching classical methods in supersymmetry searches.

**Quantum GANs:** Reduced Monte Carlo data augmentation time from months to days using
Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks with qubit encoding.

**Quantum Circuit Design:** Utilized genetic algorithms in Python and Qiskit to build
quantum circuits.

**CMS Collaboration:** Contributed to open-source code within the CMS collaboration (4000+
members).

**ASIC Calibration:** Tested and calibrated ASICs for the CMS Timing Detector upgrade
targeting a 30‚Äì40 ps resolution.

**Operations Management:** Managed computer operations for the Portuguese CMS site.

**System Debugging:** Debugged systems at the Laborat√≥rio de Instrumenta√ß√£o e F√≠sica
Experimental de Part√≠culas FARM using Slurm.

**Mentorship:** Developed and mentored a summer internship program utilizing high-energy
physics data and machine learning.

**Outreach & Representation:** Organized outreach events for students, created a lab
student council, and represented CMS-Portugal at the European Committee for Future
Accelerators Early-Career Researchers Panel.
